# Build and Deploy a React Admin Dashboard App With Theming, Tables, Charts and More


## 1. Project Planning and Requirements Gathering
Identify Requirements: Determine the specific data you need to store for employees and students (e.g., personal information, performance metrics, attendance).
User Roles: Define different user roles (e.g., admin, employee, student) and their access levels.

##2. Front-End Development with ReactJS
Component Design: Plan and design React components for different parts of the dashboard (e.g., navigation, data tables, forms).
State Management: Use state management libraries like Redux or Context API to manage the application's state.
Routing: Implement routing using React Router to navigate between different views/pages of the dashboard.
UI Frameworks: Utilize UI frameworks like Material-UI or Ant Design for consistent and responsive design.


## 3.  Data Visualization
Chart Libraries: Integrate chart libraries such as Chart.js, Recharts, or D3.js to create visual representations of the data.
Interactive Charts: Ensure charts are interactive, allowing users to filter data, zoom, and get detailed information on hover.
Types of Charts: Use different types of charts (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts) to represent various data points.


## 4. User Experience and Accessibility
Responsive Design: Ensure the dashboard is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.
Accessibility: Follow accessibility best practices to make the dashboard usable for people with disabilities.
